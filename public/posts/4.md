Its been a few weeks since I've written my last update on how quitting caffeine has been, mostly because there has been less to write about as I get more and more used to having none. Here's how the last 3 weeks have been.\
&nbsp;

I have largely gotten to a point of normalcy again, where I see all the benefits with few of the drawbacks. Around week 4, my mood was at its flattest. I strongly considered outright going back to drinking a tea every day just to go back to feeling good again. I only persevered through it by finding anecdotes of people who went through similar struggles when they quit caffeine, and figured it would at least be worth sticking at it for a few more days. And its good that I did, because I began to feel better fairly quickly after.\
&nbsp;

At this point my irritability is largely gone. My flat mood have mostly passed. The spike in anxiety I felt has also faded. But I still have a much easier time sleeping at night, sleep earlier and wake up earlier, have an easier time getting out of bed, and don't crash in the middle of the day. In other words, I feel way better than before. I have also felt an increase in motivation, maybe not to the level of the first three days, but higher than when I was frequently on caffeine. I am more introspective and have a calmer attitude.\
&nbsp;

One thing I struggled with greatly in this time was sugar cravings. From when I was down to a green tea a day onwards I began to crave sugar more and more, spiking at around week 4. I still crave sugar more than I did before (though one benefit of quitting caffeine is I can't have any soda either). I also haven't been "100% pure" about quitting caffeine, I'll still eat chocolate here and there. I am a bit more cautious about it since I don't want to overload, but I would rather be miserably addicted to caffeine than give up chocolate cake and brownies. I honestly still don't feel much of a difference when eating them, and probably wouldn't have any trouble with an occasional green tea here and there.\
&nbsp;

I write all this with the knowledge that it will be ending soon. Week 7 will be my last without any coffee, as I'll be traveling to the beautiful city of Montreal soon. There is no way I won't have a cup or two or five when I'm visiting the cafes over there, so the experiment will be at an end. I'll reflect more on what I've learned next week, but without a doubt this time will change my habits for likely the rest of my life. I have a renewed confidence that I can make active change in my life and go through it without relying on supplements like caffeine. And I doubt I'll ever go back to my 1-2 cups of coffee a day.\
