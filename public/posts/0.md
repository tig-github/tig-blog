If you know me at all, you know that I love coffee. The delightful, deep bitterness that brightens mornings and fills you with energy with just one sip is a joy I have long known. But I decided to quit it.\
&nbsp;

I'm not motivated by health primarily. I largely believe the studies that indicate coffee has positive health benefits (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5696634/). Coffee, even in relatively larger quantities like 3-4 cups, has often been shown to improve health outcomes. More studies are surely needed, but to give you an idea, the number one source of antioxidants for most Americans was coffee (https://phys.org/news/2005-08-coffee-source-antioxidants.html). I suppose is more of a condemnation on American diets, but that's a different conversation. I at least don't feel coffee is a negative influence on my health.\
&nbsp;

But there is one major and obvious caveat - caffein. The powerful substance that compels us to stay awake and keep productive, even as our bodies consume more and more energy. There is no doubt that caffein is a powerful chemical that can be used to achieve goals more effectively. But the negative effects of caffein dependency cannot be overlooked, as often as they are.\
&nbsp;

My problem with caffein stems with its addictive nature and the subtle yet insidious effects it has on a person. Caffein firstly is not free energy. What goes up must come down, and once your brain is finally allowed to bind the adenosine to its receptors, you feel it with a vengeance. Instead of a gentle flow into restfulness, you get slammed into fatigue by a brain working overtime. Secondly, caffein lingers in your system. With a half life of 6 hours, a single cup of coffee (around 90mg) will last for a significant amount of time in your system. Now, adding that up to four cups... I am not a biologist, so I am not sure if it eventually flushes downwards or continually builds up, but I would expect caffein dependence at this level to spiral out of control quickly. Caffein doesn't effect everyone the same way, but I would be surprised if most people weren't impacted by this buildup.\
&nbsp;

Thirdly, caffein interferes with your sleep. When it comes to sleep, it is remarkably easy to completely ignore the detriments of poor quality rest. If you are used to sleeping below what you need, lets say 4-6 hours a night, your able to adapt to the new normal of an unrested body. But the body is still unrested, and it does have negative effects we probably have a very small understanding of. At the very least, you will feel a lot better and have more energy if you sleep a full night. Caffein is the same, by impacting sleep quality (and possibly building on itself due to its long half life), I can't imagine a caffein dependency is great for one's health. There is also implications on anxiety levels, and a host of other side-effects, but the point is clear.\
&nbsp;

None of that is why I'm quitting. Studies still show that, despite caffein having its drawbacks, coffee is generally healthy. And I love drinking coffee. Its not as though drinking coffee is the least healthy thing I do, so its incredibly easy to rationalize a coffee addiction. Certainly there are worse vices to have, honestly maybe all of them are worse. Frankly, if drinking coffee was outright unhealthy, I still don't think that would be enough motivation for me to quit. And if health was my primary motivator, I would be investing more effort into quitting sugar instead.\
&nbsp;

I'm quitting coffee because I want freedom. I have been drinking coffee for a very long time now, probably over ten years, and am totally caffein dependent. I have gone cold turkey periods in the past where I go a month or two with less coffee, but mostly have been operating on 2-4 cups for the past decade. I am at a point now where, if I go even one day without a coffee, I will get terrible headaches later in the day, and am largely rendered unproductive. In the past months I have literally had to plan my mornings around getting caffein quickly, often having to resort to fast food drive-throughs when I'm out at home. This is hilariously sad. On a recent trip I took to San Diego, it was a pervasive need that I had to meet in the mornings. And its been getting worse.\
&nbsp;

I hate that. I hate being dependent on coffee, and I refuse to be dependent any longer. I am not quitting caffein cold turkey - I work and have responsibilities, and while I could force through the rough period I'd really rather not. But I refuse to continue this status quo, and become further and further reliant on the second most traded commodity in the world. This drink has a chokehold on the majority of humanity, and as a patriotic American it is my civic duty to declare independence from such an authoritarian force.\

&nbsp;

So to be clear, I'm quitting coffee (as of writing this, I'm 5 days in!) but not caffein. I've begun relying on black tea instead. In hindsight... switching from coffee to tea is maybe the least patriotic thing I could do. Whatever. I'm now down to about 2 black teas a day, with some green teas in the afternoon. So, by no means have I quit drinking coffee altogether. But this is still progress from where I was before. I am of the opinion that tea isn't inherently better than coffee - I find both to be very healthy caffeinated beverages, and tea does suffer the same shortfalls in being caffeinated. But it has what I need, way less caffein. Instead of drinking a cup or two of coffee, a black tea or two, and maybe a green tea, I've effectively reduced my caffein intake by a third without significant withdrawal. Over time, I'll continue to whittle down my caffein intake, until I'm only drinking green teas, which have a small enough amount of caffein that I doubt I'll ever quit them.\
&nbsp;

I am not saying I'll never drink coffee again. I'm not even saying I won't drink coffee soon. I love it way too much to commit to something like that. My goal is to remove it from my daily habit, see how it impacts my day-to-day, and enjoy them in moderation (or desperation!). That's how I used to be, and that's how I will be again.
