&nbsp;

It has been 5 days since I began my journey to quit coffee, with my reasoning explained in an earlier blog post. Now I'll go into how I've been feeling.\
&nbsp;

Better. A lot better. Surprisingly better. I expected to be in misery for a week or two, albeit not to an extreme, before slowly getting a sense of normalcy. Instead I found one of my biggest challenges immediately remedied, and a host of other issues solved - with a few withdrawal effects as well. The significance of how I feel might also be impacted by placebo, but if I feel it that's good enough for me.\
&nbsp;

The first day did kind of suck. I had three black teas, Irish Breakfast being my pick, and probably a few green teas later as well. Yet I was still pretty despondent for most of that first day, only narrowly staving off a headache. It felt a lot like how I would have if I had only drunken one cup of coffee with no seconds or teas, a bit of a sign that quitting was the right choice.\
&nbsp;

What I noticed as the days continued was my mid-day crash, my personal siesta, had almost completely vanished. I had already made some strides to reduce it by delaying my first cup of coffee, but this was different. When before I was heavily fatigued in the mid-day before receiving a burst of energy in the evening, I now had a much more normal and gradual decline through the day. I still feel a very light version of this trend, but then I do still drink a good amount of caffein, and some form of this is probably normal. There are a few reasons I think this may be the case. The first is, coffee has a variety of compounds other than caffein that probably contribute greatly to the 'rush' the drink provides. Tea famously has the opposite, L-Theanine, which helps mask the effects of caffein as well. This was another reason I chose tea as my drink of choice over other options - absolutely no caffein pills for me.\
&nbsp;

I also felt a burse in productivity. I had a significantly enhanced ability to take care of chores or other obligations that normally would have been put off for a time. I should note this mostly impacted my personal life, I haven't seen a significant improvement in productivity at work where I'm already very productive. This boost in productivity is very welcome, as one of my main reasons for wanting to reduce caffein intake was to increase my actual energy. And if its just a placebo, then I'll take whatever works.\
&nbsp;

One downside that has nothing to do with coffee and everything to do with tea is, when I drink black tea in the morning, I need to eat something with it. I am not sure why, but I feel queasy if I drink tea on an empty stomach. I get none of this from coffee, probably because I'm so used to it, but tea gives me this unpleasant feeling every now and then. So while I previously always skipped breakfast, now I have to commit to eating a bit more in the morning.\
&nbsp;

Another downside that is directly related to caffein is increased irritability. I haven't been mean, but I noticed my patience has gone down and my general social mood has darkened. Which I did not expect AT ALL, I totally thought it would be the opposite. I later learned this was a normal effect of quitting caffein, but it blindsided me at the time.\
&nbsp;

So while there are a few drawbacks, overall I feel much better and more active as a result of substituting my coffee drinking with tea. Over time I'll continue to reduce the amount of caffein until I'm only drinking green teas. By the ends of week 2 or 3 I hope to cut black tea entirely, and eventually see if I can go days without any tea. If I can, that's a success to me.\
